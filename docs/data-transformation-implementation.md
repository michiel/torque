# Data Transformation Optimization Implementation Plan

Based on the review in `docs/reviews/2025-07-12-data-transformations.md`, this document outlines the implementation plan for optimizing data transformations across the Torque platform.

## Overview

The goal is to minimize data transformations between database storage and frontend components by aligning data structures across all layers of the stack.

## Phase 1: High Priority (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Standardize UUID Representations
- [ ] Update database entity models to use string UUIDs
- [ ] Remove UUID to string conversions in GraphQL layer
- [ ] Update frontend types to use consistent UUID string type
- [ ] Add UUID format validation at API boundaries

### 1.2 Standardize DateTime Handling
- [ ] Implement ISO 8601 serialization for all DateTime fields
- [ ] Update GraphQL schema to use consistent date format
- [ ] Remove RFC3339 conversions
- [ ] Add timezone handling utilities for frontend

### 1.3 Direct JSONB Mapping for TorqueApp
- [ ] Create direct entity data accessor in JSON-RPC handlers
- [ ] Remove intermediate transformation layers
- [ ] Implement type-safe JSONB to TypeScript mapping
- [ ] Add runtime validation for entity data

## Phase 2: Medium Priority (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Add UI Hints to Entity Storage
- [ ] Extend entity schema with `_ui` metadata field
- [ ] Store component type hints with entity fields
- [ ] Implement UI hint extraction in entity service
- [ ] Update frontend to use UI hints directly

### 2.2 Optimize GraphQL Type Conversions
- [ ] Implement derive macros for automatic type conversion
- [ ] Remove duplicate type definitions
- [ ] Use GraphQL custom scalars for common types
- [ ] Reduce nested object transformations

### 2.3 Implement Field Projections
- [ ] Add field selection to entity queries
- [ ] Implement partial entity loading
- [ ] Update caching to support field-level granularity
- [ ] Add GraphQL field resolvers for lazy loading

## Phase 3: Low Priority (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Create fast paths for common entity operations
- [ ] Implement transformation result caching
- [ ] Add SIMD JSON parsing for bulk operations
- [ ] Optimize memory allocation for transformations

### 3.2 Monitoring and Metrics
- [ ] Add transformation performance metrics
- [ ] Implement transformation timing logging
- [ ] Create performance dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerts for transformation bottlenecks

### 3.3 Developer Experience
- [ ] Create transformation debugging tools
- [ ] Add development mode transformation logging
- [ ] Build transformation visualization tools
- [ ] Document best practices for minimal transformations

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with TorqueApp optimizations** - These provide immediate user-facing benefits
2. **Then optimize Model Editor** - Improve developer experience
3. **Finally add monitoring** - Ensure optimizations are effective

## Success Metrics

- Reduce API response times by 10-20ms
- Decrease memory usage by 50% for large datasets
- Eliminate 3-4 transformation layers
- Achieve <10ms entity CRUD operations

## Migration Strategy

1. Implement new data paths alongside existing ones
2. Use feature flags to gradually enable optimizations
3. Monitor performance metrics during rollout
4. Keep rollback procedures ready

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for each transformation removal
- Integration tests for end-to-end data flow
- Performance benchmarks before/after optimization
- Load testing with large datasets
