# Torque Project Memory

## Current Session Context

### Project Overview
Torque is a high-performance platform for designing, running, and presenting applications. It enables dynamic application generation from visual models, targeting both web frontends for humans and MCP APIs for AI agents.

### Session Timeline
1. **Started**: Continuation from previous conversation that ran out of context
2. **Initial Issues**: User reported Model Editor development environment problems
3. **Investigation**: Identified and fixed WebSocket connection issues
4. **Phase 3 Implementation**: Completed TorqueApp Runtime with JSON-RPC API and React frontend
5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive README.md

- AI-friendly data formats and query capabilities

### Architecture Details

#### Backend (Rust) - Port 8080
- **Axum HTTP Server**: Main application server
- **GraphQL API**: `/graphql` endpoint for Model Editor operations
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 API**: `/rpc` endpoint for TorqueApp runtime
- **WebSocket API**: `/ws` endpoint for real-time synchronization
- **Health Endpoints**: `/health`, `/metrics`, `/status`

#### Frontend Applications
- **Model Editor**: Port 3000 - React app for visual model design
- **TorqueApp Runtime**: Port 3001 - React app for running dynamic applications

### Key Technical Achievements

#### WebSocket Connection Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Rapid connect/disconnect cycles with 50+ connections per second
- **Root Cause**: React hooks dependency array issues causing constant WebSocket reconnections
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Stabilized client ID using global variable persistence
  - Fixed useEffect dependencies to use primitive values instead of functions
  - Used useMemo for WebSocket URL generation instead of useCallback
  - Added connection state checks to prevent duplicate connections

#### Model Service Implementation (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: `get_models()` returning empty array despite created models
- **Root Cause**: Method was placeholder returning empty vector instead of checking cache
- **Fix Applied**: Updated to iterate through DashMap cache and return non-expired models

### Development Environment
- **Backend**: `cargo run -p torque -- server` or `./scripts/dev.sh`
- **Model Editor**: `cd frontend/model-editor && npm run dev`
- **TorqueApp**: `cd frontend/torque-client && npm run dev`
- **Full Environment**: `./scripts/dev.sh` (starts backend + Model Editor)
- **Testing**: `./scripts/test-dev.sh` (Playwright end-to-end tests)

### API Endpoints Working
- âœ… **GraphQL**: `http://localhost:8080/graphql` - Model CRUD operations
- âœ… **JSON-RPC**: `http://localhost:8080/rpc` - TorqueApp runtime methods
- âœ… **WebSocket**: `ws://localhost:8080/ws` - Real-time model synchronization
- âœ… **Health**: `http://localhost:8080/health` - Server health check

### User Verification
- âœ… **Model Editor Works**: User confirmed can create models and they appear in list

- âœ… **Development Environment**: Both backend and frontend start successfully

### Next Planned Work (Phase 4)

### Latest Session Work (2025-07-11)

#### JSON Parsing and Entity Display Fix
- **Problem**: Customer Order Management model showing "0 entities" despite successful backend loading
- **Root Cause**: Database UNIQUE constraint conflict when reloading existing models during development
- **Solution**: Added proper duplicate model handling with `get_model_by_name_and_version()` method
- **Result**: Model now displays correctly with 2 entities, 1 relationship, 2 flows, 3 layouts
- **Testing**: Verified with Playwright tests and direct GraphQL API calls
- **Performance**: Confirmed <50ms GraphQL responses and complete entity data serialization

### Context for Future Sessions
This session focused on fixing the JSON parsing issue that was preventing proper entity display in the Model Editor. The Customer Order Management sample model is now fully functional, displaying complete entity structures with all fields, relationships, flows, and layouts. 

All Phase 3 objectives have been completed successfully:
- âœ… TorqueApp Runtime with JSON-RPC API
- âœ… Dynamic React frontend with component system
- âœ… Sample model parsing and display
- âœ… Complete development environment

The project is now ready for Phase 4 XFlow Engine development.

1. WebSocket connection problems - FIXED (previous session)
2. Model Editor showing errors - RESOLVED (previous session)  
3. Development environment instability - STABILIZED (previous session)
4. JSON parsing and entity display - FIXED (this session)

Current git branch: `main`
Current commit: Ready for new commit with JSON parsing fixes
