# Torque Implementation Plan

**Project Status**: 🎯 **Priority Refocus - TorqueApp MVP**  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-23  
**Current Priority**: Implement functional TorqueApp MVP with DataGrid rendering and data population

---

## 🚨 Critical Priority: TorqueApp MVP Implementation

**Context**: During testing, we discovered that the TorqueApp frontend (Phase 3) is incomplete. While the JSON-RPC API infrastructure exists, the actual dynamic React frontend that renders layouts and populates DataGrids with data is not functional.

**Immediate Goal**: Implement a minimal viable TorqueApp that can:
1. ✅ Load start page layouts via JSON-RPC 
2. ✅ Render DataGrid components dynamically
3. ✅ Populate DataGrids with actual entity data 
4. ✅ Function as an embeddable standalone React component
5. ✅ Support model app preview in the Model Editor frontend

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Fix First**: Repair existing torque-client instead of rewriting
2. **Sample-Driven**: Use todo-app model as primary test case
3. **Incremental**: Get basic rendering working, then add features
4. **Real Data**: Focus on actual entity data, not mock data
5. **Embed Early**: Design for embedding from the start

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run Torque server
cargo run -- server --bind 127.0.0.1:8081

# Terminal 2: Load sample data
cargo run -- model import sample/models/todo-app.json
cargo run -- model load-sample-data "Todo Application"

# Terminal 3: Run TorqueApp frontend  
cd frontend/torque-client && npm run dev

# Terminal 4: Run Model Editor (for preview integration)
cd frontend/model-editor && npm run dev
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Manual Testing**: Browser-based testing with real models
2. **Component Testing**: Individual component rendering
3. **Integration Testing**: Full model-to-app workflow
4. **Embedding Testing**: TorqueApp component in isolation

## 📋 Implementation Guidelines

### Priority Levels (Updated)
- **P1**: Critical for MVP - blocks basic functionality
- **P2**: Important for production but not MVP-blocking
- **P3**: Nice-to-have features for future releases

### Development Standards
- **MVP First**: Only implement what's needed for basic functionality
- **Real Data**: Use actual entities, not mock data
- **Component Isolation**: Each component should work independently
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing data/APIs

### Quality Gates (MVP)
- [ ] Basic TorqueApp renders without errors
- [ ] DataGrid shows real entity data
- [ ] Component embedding works in isolation
- [ ] Model Editor preview integration functional

---

## 🔄 Risk Management (Updated)

### Critical MVP Risks
- **Data Loading**: Sample data may not load correctly into entities table
- **JSON-RPC Integration**: Existing API may not provide required data format
- **Component Rendering**: Dynamic component system may have gaps
- **Embedding Architecture**: Component isolation may break existing patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development**: Get basic DataGrid working first
- **Sample Data Priority**: Ensure todo-app sample data loads reliably
- **Component Testing**: Test each component in isolation before integration
- **Fallback Plans**: Simple static rendering if dynamic system fails
