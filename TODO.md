- **Performance Optimizations**: No SIMD, DashMap, or partitioning implemented
- **Advanced Components**: Chart component specified but not implemented

---

## üéØ **STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS**

### Immediate Decision: Focus on Data Entry Excellence

**Recommendation**: Abandon enterprise integration features and focus on becoming the **best-in-class internal data entry platform**.

**Rationale**:
1. **Specification Mismatch**: 85% of spec focuses on features not implemented
2. **Market Position**: Internal data entry applications have clear value proposition  
3. **Implementation Reality**: Current code excellently supports data entry use cases
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Leverage existing 90% complete implementation
